# RenewedVillageGrowth
RVG is a Game Script that manages towns growth in a new and balanced way, making growth depend on varied cargo delivery (passengers, food, goods, ...) and sustained transportation of passangers and mails. The script supports Baseset, FIRS, ECS, YETI and NAIS industries. It is born as a combination of keoz's Renewed City Growth GS and Sylf's City Growth Limiter GS.
